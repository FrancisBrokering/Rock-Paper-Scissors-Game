# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is my first project using React. It is a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the user chooses a button out of the options "rock, paper, and scissors". When one of the buttons is clicked, the computer's hand will be randomly generated out of the options "rock, paper, and scissors". The result of who one will be displayed at the bottom.
## Motivation
To learn the basics of React.js and compare it with Vue.js which I have previously used for a school project. In this project, I used several React Hooks such as useState and useEffect.
